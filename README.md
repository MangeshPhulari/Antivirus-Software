# Antivirus-Software

# Abstract

This is a small antivirus which identifies virus in the
pc by using the signature-based detection technique. For this signature-based
detection we used three types of virus signatures. The virus signature types are MD5,
SHA1 and SHA256. There are over 72,000 virus signatures of each type in the
database of this project which is used for detection of the virus. This project can
detect pre-pended and appended types of viruses which are attached at either at the
front of the program or at the end part of the program.
